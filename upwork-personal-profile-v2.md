## Overview
Ex‑Alibaba/Ant Staff Engineer and current CTO specializing in enterprise‑grade platforms using Java/Spring Boot, React/TypeScript, and AWS/Kubernetes. I help startups and enterprises build and scale products from MVP to millions of users with a focus on performance, reliability, and clear documentation.

Selected impact: helped expand DingTalk international to millions of DAU; led low‑code platform initiatives at Ant Group that reduced delivery time by 70%; stabilized peak‑season traffic for a leading fashion e‑commerce platform.

What I do
- Enterprise architecture reviews and modernization (monolith → microservices)
- High‑scale e‑commerce platforms (catalog, cart, checkout, payments)
- Microservices and API ecosystems (REST, auth, multi‑tenant)
- Performance, reliability, and cost optimization (profiling, caching, DB tuning)
- Cloud and DevOps (AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, CI/CD)
- Technical leadership, roadmaps, and documentation

How I work
- Architecture first with measurable KPIs and risk mitigation
- Iterative delivery with weekly demos and transparent progress
- Clean, maintainable code and a thorough handover package

Recent outcomes
- Grew international DAU from 0 → millions for a workplace app
- Reduced application delivery time by ~70% via low‑code platform
- Improved page load p95 by 40% and throughput 10× for e‑commerce flows
- Ensured stability under major shopping‑event peak traffic
